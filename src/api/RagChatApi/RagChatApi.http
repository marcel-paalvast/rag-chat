Simple Pancake Recipe

Ingredients
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1 egg
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Instructions
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
2. In another bowl, beat the egg and then whisk in the milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.
4. Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil.
5. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.
6. Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through.
7. Serve warm with your favorite toppings.
